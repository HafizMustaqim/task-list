## About
This project is a simple Task List application with fully functional CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. It is built using:

- **Laravel** for the backend framework
- **Alpine.js** for frontend interactivity
- **MySQL** for database storage
- **Laragon** for local development environment setup

The Task List application allows users to manage tasks efficiently by adding, viewing, editing, and deleting tasks.

## Features
- **Create tasks**: Add new tasks with titles and descriptions.
- **View tasks**: List all tasks with their current status.
- **Update tasks**: Edit task details to reflect changes.
- **Delete tasks**: Remove tasks that are no longer needed.

## How to Run
- **Warm-Up**: Do dynamic stretches and light jogging to prepare your body.
- **Starting Position**: Get into a strong stance with your feet behind the start line, hands flat, and body leaning forward.
- **Strong Start**: Explode from the blocks or your stance with short, powerful strides.
- **Max Speed**: Gradually stand upright, lengthen your stride, and maintain rhythm as you reach top speed.
- **Finish Strong**: Keep your form, focus on the finish line, and use a final burst of energy to cross the line.
